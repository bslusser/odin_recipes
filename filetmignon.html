    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Filet Mignon, translated from French as ‘cute fillet’ or ‘dainty fillet’,  is often referred to as tenderloin steak. It has a very mild beef aroma and mild beef flavor when compared to other steaks and needs additional steps to make it more flavorful. Some chefs call filet mignon overrated, but most of us love it. When cooked right it's very tender, flavorful and tasty.</p>

    <h3>Filet Mignon Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 filet mignon steaks (tenderloin steaks should be 2-inch thick)</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp good quality olive oil</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>Kosher salt (to taste)</li>
        <li>Black pepper (coarsely ground, to taste)</li>
        <li>8 Tbsp butter (1 stick, unsalted)</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp fresh rosemary (finely chopped)</li>
        <li>1/2 Tbsp fresh parsley (finely chopped)</li>
        <li>1/2 Tbsp fresh oregano (finely chopped)</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic (blanched for 1 minute in hot water, then minced or pressed)</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 410F.</li>
        <li>To make the compound butter, take the butter out of the fridge and let it sit at room temperature while preparing herbs and garlic. In the meantime, rinse rosemary, parsley and oregano, chop and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped herbs and minced garlic, and mix in until evenly distributed. Shape into a log and refrigerate until ready to use. Remove the butter from the fridge 10 minutes prior to using.</li>
        <li>Remove filet mignon steaks from the fridge about 45-60 minutes before cooking and let come up to room temperature. Liberally season with salt and pepper on both sides just before searing.</li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil and the butter in a large (12") cast iron pan over medium-high heat. When the butter starts smoking and turns dark brown in color, place the filets in the pan and sear undisturbed for about 2 minutes. Flip and sear for another 2 minutes. Flip the steaks again and immediately transfer the pan into the preheated oven.</li>
        <li>Bake to desired doneness: rare - 120F-125F, medium rare - 130F-135F, medium - 140F-145F, medium well - 150F-155F and well done - 160F-165F.</li>
        <li>Remove the filets from the skillet and place on a platter. Cover with foil and let the steaks rest for 3 minutes. Top with a slice of compound butter and serve immediately....</li>
